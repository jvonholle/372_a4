It is a flashlight! You pick it up and check for batteries, still there, holding your breath you flick the switch.
To your disbelief, it works. Using your newfound tool to glance around again, you can more clearly see the three paths ahead of you, above
them there are several odd carvings. Looking down you see the brightly colored frog that hopped off your foot when you moved to get the flashlight.
You're glad you didn't lick it. Again, you think you can hear a creek off in the distance, but you can't be sure. The scent of fresh air you caught
a wiff of before is starting to dissipate.
