    <Description>
You're back where you woke up, once again you think you can smell fresh air, but can't tell from where.
You spot what you thought might have been a flashlight again on the ground, this time a little more clearly, it's now obvious that
it is a flashlight. Off in the distance you hear something that might be a creek gurgling, but you can't be sure. It's terribly 
dark in here. As your eyes ajust you can make out three paths ahead of you, behind you is nothing but a smooth wall. You can feel
you think is a frog on your foot.
