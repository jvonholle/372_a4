Shining the light of your flashlight at the markings above the three hallways. Above the left one you see a detailed engraving of what looks like 
a raven, sitting atop a skull, adorned with gold and other materials. Paning to the right, you see a carving of a wolf's head guarding the center path with teeth bared.
Above the last corridor is a single rose, its petals shining in response to the light of your flashlight striking them, after the initial impressivness of the ruby petals wears off,
you notice that the thorns on the stem of the rose are also highlighted with a red material. These highlights however are a much deeper, violent red. You can't tell why but they are
deeply disturbing.
